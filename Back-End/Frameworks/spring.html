      The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control
      container for the Java platform.[2] The framework's core features can be
      used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web
      applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. The
      framework does not impose any specific programming model.[citation
      needed]. The framework has become popular in the Java community as an
      addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.[3] The Spring Framework
      is free and open source software. The Spring Framework
      has its own Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) framework that modularizes
      cross-cutting concerns in aspects.[61] The motivation for creating a
      separate AOP framework is to provide basic AOP features without too much
      complexity in either design, implementation, or configuration. The Spring
      AOP framework takes full advantage of the Spring container. The Spring AOP
      framework is proxy pattern-based.[62][24] It is configured at run
      time.[citation needed] This removes the need for a compilation step or
      load-time weaving.[citation needed] On the other hand, interception only
      allows for public method-execution on existing objects at a join
      point.[citation needed]
